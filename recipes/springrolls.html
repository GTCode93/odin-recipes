        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>
            <em>Spring rolls</em>, or <em>Gỏi Cuốn</em> in Vietnamese, are rolled appetizers or dim sum commonly found in Chinese and other Southeast Asian cuisines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I know them, they are rolls made of white rice noodles, shrimp or other types of meat, and herbs and greens like basil, mint, chives, and lettuce, all wrapped in rice paper with a creamy and savory peanut dipping sauce.

        <h1>Preparation</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cooking Shrimp</strong>
                <p>
                    Typically, spring rolls are made with shrimp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Defrost shrimp in water bowl. Once defrosted, de-vein the shrimp. Hold a shrimp up to a light to locate the vein, pierce the whiter part (joint) of the shrimp just below the vein with a toothpick, and pull the toothpick upwards towards the shrimp back. Do this slowly to remove the vein. Piece again at another joint if the vein breaks to remove all traces of vein. Repeat with all your shrimp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cook the shrimp: add shrimp, salt, and enough water in a small pot to barely cover your shrimp. Boil on medium-high heat for only about 1.5 to 2.5 minutes or until the shrimp is no longer translucent. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Remove the shells and tails from shrimp, and cut the shrimp in half along the body.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rice noodles</strong>
                <p>
                    Cook either your rice noodles according to the package instructions. Timing can vary wildly depending on noodle thickness and brand. This can be anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. Drain and cool the noodles under cold, running water to stop it from cooking further. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Veggies</strong>
                <p>
                    Rinse them thoroughly and dry them. Remove leaves from mint and basil if they are still on the stem and set aside or use a salad spinner to dry. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Assembly</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout this process, keep in mind not to overflow the rice paper for ease of rolling.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak a spring roll wrapper for 5-10 seconds in a bowl of water, under the tap, or in a spring roll soaker.
            <p>
                Remove the sheet before it gets too soft and sticky and place on your working area.
            </p>
        <li>Add your herbs and lettuce in the middle of the wrapper.
            <p>
                Leave about an inch on either side of the rice paper to wrap later.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Add your shrimp (or other meat) ontop of the greens.
            <p>
                If you're using shrimp, add around 3-4 shrimp for each roll.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer on your white noodles or bánh hỏi and spread evenly across.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Lastly, we'll roll everything together.</strong>
            <p>
                Fold the left and right sides towards the middle so that it's snug. Lay some chives lengthwise with one end poking out. Then fold the bottom up to cover the noodles. You want to keep the roll tight, so lightly squeeze it together as you roll. Continue to roll upwards to complete the spring roll.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Peanut Dipping Sauce</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a pan over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and water and mix thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring to boil, and then immediately turn off the heat and pour into a heat safe dipping bowl. The sauce will slightly thicken as it cools.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle ground peanuts on each sauce dipping bowl, and leave the chile paste on the side so others can add to their own dipping bowl as desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
