        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p><em>Spam musubi</em>  is a snack and lunch food composed of a slice of grilled Spam sandwiched either in between or on top of a block of rice, wrapped together with nori in the tradition of Japanese onigiri.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces of Spam (about 2 cans)</li>
            <li>Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi cut into halves or thirds (thirds make it wrap around further)</li>
            <li>6 cups of cooked sushi rice <em>without</em> vinegar added</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Ziplock bag.</strong>
                <p>
                    Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.
                </p>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Drain off marinade and fry Spam on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or at your desired doneness.</strong>
                <p>
                    Some people like to glaze the Spam with the marinade after frying, it's up to you!

        </ol>
        <h1>Assembly</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Place a strip of nori</strong> on your work surface <em>shiny side down</em>.
                Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori. Add sushi rice to the mold (the Spam can), pressing down firmly and evenly, so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice.
                <p>
                    Dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Remove the mold from the rice and lay it right onto the nori.</strong>
                <p>
                    Add a slice of the cooked Spam on top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed.
