Introduction:
This project is to the HTML, Git, and GitHub skills I've learned from The Odin Project by creating a website that explains how to make pizza, spring rolls, and spam musubi. 

Mid-Project Updates: 

I understand now how git commits work! Unfortunately I understood half-way through this project, so the git commits at the beginning will look a little janky and not as accurate as I would have liked according to the lesson on Commit Messages. I know it now, though. 



Self Reflection:
