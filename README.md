Introduction:
This project is to show off the HTML, Git, and GitHub skills I've learned from The Odin Project by creating a website that explains how to make pizza, spring rolls, and spam musubi. 

Mid-Project Updates: 
I understand now how git commits work! Unfortunately I understood half-way through this project, so the git commits at the beginning will look a little janky and not as accurate as I would have liked according to the lesson on Commit Messages. I know it now, though.



Self Reflection:
I really enjoyed this project in practicing my HTML! I now understand Git and GitHub's usefulness and how to utilize what they offer developers. Besides, it was very fun editing the pages I wrote for readability and formatting.
